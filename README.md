# OAuthTestServers

This project was used to develop and test the OAuthVulnerability Scanner

  https://github.com/vagelkara/OAuthVulnerabilityScanner
  
In order someone to run the different servers that are supported should clone the repo and the relevant submodules and to use the `init.sh` bash script under the /OAuthServers directory to initiate the servers following the options that would be prompted. Accordingly, using the `stop_all.sh` script could stop all the OAuth instances that are running.
